=== Description ===
[MATLAB]
Please unzip the 'Matlab'.
You can find 'Scripts' folder which stores the scripts with .m files and .pdf, final models with .mat files, and the datasets with .csv files.
Please download all .m and .mat files including all datasets below and save them in the one same folder.
There are codes in each script to import the right datasets and models below.
However, if there is an error while importing, please import .mat and .csv files by clicking from the current folder panel to upload them to the workspace for the scripts below.

-- File
*train_model_RF.m: The script about training the model with random forest.
*train_model_LR.m: The script about training the model with logistic regression.
*test_final_models.m: The script about testing the final models with random forest and logistic regression.
*rf_final_mdl.mat: The final model with random forest.
*lr_final_mdl.mat: The final model with logistic regression.

-- Dataset
*data.csv: A dataset used for training the models with random forest and logistic regression.
*testset.csv: A testing dataset used for testing the final models with random forest and logistic regression.

-- Code in PDF
*train_model_RF.pdf: PDF version
*train_model_LR.pdf: PDF version
*test_final_models.pdf: PDF version

[Jupyter Notebook]
Please unzip the 'Jupyter notebook_Initial analysis'.
You can find 'Initial analysis' folder which stores the scripts with .ipynb file and .pdf, and the datasets with .csv files.
These files and datasets below are about prior analysis about the original dataset and the process of getting a dataset for a case study.

-- File
*230003122_Yumi Heo_Initial Analysis of Dataset.ipynb: Initial analysis of the selected dataset, IPython notebooks file

-- Dataset
*SBAnational.csv: The original dataset from kaggle.
If the size of the dataset matters, please download the original dataset through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied
*data.csv: A dataset for a case study used for modeling.
